Influence of standards and tools.
The influence and adoption rates of the standards and tools recommended in this paper are quantified by three measures.
The annual citation rate for the primary publication is measured by Google Scholar, and, where available, by PubMed. The latter is more indicative of the influence on biomedical research.
Entries are sorted by their Google Scholar citation rates.
In addition, data from a survey of 210 members of the biomodeling community that asked which tools, resources or languages they most frequently used have been added~\cite{szigeti2018blueprint}.
The Type column categorizes each tool by its overall purpose.\\

Reproducible methods were used to construct this table.
Two hand-curated tables were input: a list of the standards and tools containing the titles of their primary publications, and a LaTeX bibliography containing the papers.
The publication year and Google Scholar citation counts were obtained for each paper via a Google Scholar API.
PubMed citation counts were obtained via the PubMed API \cite{sayers2010general}.
Survey results were integrated from a spreadsheet in the GitHub repository~\cite{szigeti2018blueprint_repo} for~\cite{szigeti2018blueprint}.
These analyses can be reproduced by executing a single command.
The hand-curated tables and source code for this analysis are available at \cite{GoldbergReproToolsAnalysis}.
